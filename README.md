**Introduction**

Conducting job interviews can be a tedious and tiring task and during the pandemic we saw the introduction of online job interviews which made life somewhat easier. However, there are still many problems with even whilst having the facility of job interviews online.  Many candidates  find it difficult to conduct themselves in online interviews, which is relatively new to them. They fail to comprehend that straight postures, and well-managed tone is as important in online interviews, as it is in person.

Moreover, it’s common for fresh graduates/first-time job-seekers to fail job interviews in their first try. As they are new to the corporate world, they have little to no knowledge about how to behave and answer interview questions. We aim to counter this, by giving them a platform in which they can practice giving AI job Interviews, so they are ready for the real world. 

The aim of our project is to create an AI based mock job interview system, where questions are generated for a candidate and a score is calculated, through which both their competency to answer the questions and their behavior (facial expression, eye movement, hand gesture) is analyzed and scored, showing candidates’ weak and strong points.
